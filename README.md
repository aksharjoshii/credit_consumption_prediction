# Predict Credit Consumption of Customer

## Business Context

In the modern business landscape, analytics plays a crucial role across industries, utilizing various technology platforms to collect and analyze data. The Credit Card industry, being data-rich, provides opportunities to understand and leverage customer behavior effectively. Analyzing data from a credit card processor can reveal valuable insights into consumer types and their spending behaviors. This, in turn, allows companies to develop targeted marketing campaigns, leading to increased sales and revenue.

Understanding the consumption patterns of individual consumers is vital for effective customer relationship management. This understanding enables banks to tailor their services to individual consumers, facilitating the development of strategic marketing plans. Therefore, studying the relationship between consumer characteristics and their credit card consumption patterns is imperative.

## Business Objectives

This project aims to analyze data provided by one of the leading banks, including:

a. **Customer Demographics**
b. **Customer Behavioral Data:** Information on liabilities, assets, and transaction history with the bank for each customer. The data covers credit card spending in the previous 3 months (April, May, and June) and the expected average spend in the coming 3 months (July, August, and September).
c. **Credit Consumption**

## Model Evaluation Metric

The model's performance will be evaluated using the Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) between the predicted credit card consumption and the actual credit consumption. This metric provides a comprehensive measure of the accuracy of the predictive model, considering both the magnitude and percentage error of predictions.
